# About me
I am 27 years old. Unfortunately, I cannot disclose who I work for, due to activities that do not allow me to talk about my work. Not so long ago I was engaged in network administration of a telecommunications system in the ZABBIX monitoring system, for which I began to study a new direction for myself as the JavaScript programming language. Which, in turn, radically changed my point of view in relation to my work, and I decided to delve into the study of this language, as well as everything that is necessary to follow the path of a JS / FE developer.
